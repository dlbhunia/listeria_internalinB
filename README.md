This repository contains example data files and the code that was used to analyze them, originally presented in (Liu et al., 2023). There are two separate folders that can be used to analyze results from ClusPRO and the MD trajectory file. 

Each of the folders in this repository contain a detailed read_me that discusses how to use the code contained in that folder to analyze the sample data, also contained within that folder.
